      footer: `Atomicswapwallet.io is proudly presenting first ever decentralized service for direct exchange between Bitcoin and EOS blockchains.
        Here we’re solving the bulk of problems with the EOS and Bitcoin exchange. Firstly, it is a registration in the EOS network,
        well-known for its rather cumbersome design. On Atomicswapwallet.io you can get it in a couple of seconds for small registration fee.
        Secondly, it is a problem of EOS integration into the wallets with mass-adopted blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
        At the moment, vast majority of EOS users store and exchange it via the EOS-pegged services which results in the complicated
        interaction with Bitcoin and Ethereum.
        Centralized exchanges offer poor remedy for this problem since they demand KYC/AML-procedures and store users’ keys and funds.
        Atomicswapwallet.io team finalized first direct EOS-to-Bitcoin Atomic Swap in September, 2018 and now it allows users to exchange their crypto with no third party involved.
        EOS itself is one of the world leading dApp-hosting platforms and very promising blockchain widely called ‘Ethereum-killer’ for the high scalability and developability.
        So, Atomicswapwallet.io provides users with the possibility to invest in the rising and prospective project using familiar Bitcoin and Ethereum coins.
        Moreover, even USDT is accepted on our platform which makes the EOS purchasing easier than ever.`,
